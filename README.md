# deep_learning_framework

This repository is my "crack" at implementing a deep learning framework following this [guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-diy-deep-learning-framework-in-numpy-59b5b618f9b7). As you can see from the example usecases demonstrated below, the API is **heavily** inspired by that of PyTorch's (don't need to change what is good :)). 

## Implemented/Planned Features
### Layers
- [x] Linear Layers
- [x] Conv2D
- [x] MaxPool2D
- [ ] rnn
- [ ] lstm
### Activations
- [x] Sigmoid
- [x] ReLU
- [x] LeakyReLu
- [x] SoftMax

### Loss functions
- [x] MSELoss
- [ ] L1Loss
- [x] CrossEntropyLoss
- [ ] BinaryCrossEntropyLoss

### Utilities
- [ ] Dataloader
- [ ] CustomDataset
- [ ] Train
- [ ] CrossValidate
- [ ] EarlyStopping
- [ ] Save Model
- [ ] Load Model
- [ ] Pretrainded Model
- [ ] CUDA Support

## Example Use Cases

### MLP
```python

```


### Classification MLP

### Convnet
