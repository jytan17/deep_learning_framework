# deep_learning_framework

This repository is my "crack" at implementing a deep learning framework following this [guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-diy-deep-learning-framework-in-numpy-59b5b618f9b7). As you can see from the example usecases demonstrated below, the API is **heavily** inspired by that of PyTorch's (don't need to change what is good :)). 

# Implemented/Planned Features
